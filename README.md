This is my first AI program and I wrote it without having the knowledge of how to write an AI program. It clicked in me somehow.
There is still room for a lot of improvement.

IMPORTANT: whenever new training data is added you must run sort_training_data.py and rename the file it generates to training_data.txt

Caution!: Make sure the training data is sorted otherwise the program will not work correctly
